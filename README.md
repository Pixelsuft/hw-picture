# hw-picture
My Happy Wheels Picture Uploader Script, But *.exe
# How does it work?
Generating level data.
# Language?
Before - PHP (example.php).
Now - PHP, but compiled in PHP Devel Studio 3.0 beta
# Max picture size?
Every pixel - is 5x5 object(min).
Max objects=10000.
=Max Picture size=100x100.
But you can use downgrader and chromakey.
# What if i have other system (not windows)?
Create local server (/upload to your hosting) with example.php and image.png. Open example.php and click 'view source code'. Add all <sh> tags to group in your level data
